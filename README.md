cookie parser
cookie-parser. Parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a secret string, which assigns req.secret so it may be used by other middleware.

body-parser
__________________
Node.js body parsing middleware.

This does not handle multipart bodies, due to their complex and typically large nature. For multipart bodies, you may be interested in the following modules:

    busboy and connect-busboy
    multiparty and connect-multiparty
    formidable
    multer
    
    The bodyParser object exposes various factories to create middlewares. All middlewares will populate the req.body property with the parsed body, or an empty object ({}) if there was no body to parse (or an error was returned).
    
    The various errors returned by this module are described in the errors section.
